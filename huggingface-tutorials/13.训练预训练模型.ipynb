    "# Train with a script\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with the ðŸ¤— Transformers notebooks, there are also example scripts demonstrating how to train a model for a task with PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX/Flax.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also find scripts weâ€™ve used in our research projects and legacy examples which are mostly community contributed. These scripts are not actively maintained and require a specific version of ðŸ¤— Transformers that will most likely be incompatible with the latest version of the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example scripts are not expected to work out-of-the-box on every problem, and you may need to adapt the script to the problem youâ€™re trying to solve. To help you with this, most of the scripts fully expose how data is preprocessed, allowing you to edit it as necessary for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any feature youâ€™d like to implement in an example script, please discuss it on the forum or in an issue before submitting a Pull Request. While we welcome bug fixes, it is unlikely we will merge a Pull Request that adds more functionality at the cost of readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will show you how to run an example summarization training script in PyTorch and TensorFlow. All examples are expected to work with both frameworks unless otherwise specified."
